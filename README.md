In this repository you can find the code that makes *stats2020.com* so nice.
- Folder *coronastats_parse* contains Matlab code which creates the data.json file using latest data from ECDC. On May 13, 2020, all the data handling was moved to the client side with dataProcessing.js.
- Folder *public* contains website's front-end that loads data.json.
