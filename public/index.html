                             In this chart you can find data on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate">case fatality rate</a> (CFR) since the pandemic started. Case fatality rate is defined here as the total number of reported deaths divided by the total number of confirmed cases. The index here is only calculated for days where the cumulative number of cases exceeds 1000.
                            
                            <p>
                            The case fatality rate is one measure of risk and should not be assumed to be equal the exact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate">mortality (or death) rate</a>. Because there are many people who may be infected but are asymptomatic, presymptomatic, or otherwise not tested (and thus not formally diagnosed with COVID-19), the CFR may overestimate the risk of death. Given the limitations of testing, an exact mortality rate would be difficult to calculate.
                            </p>
                                  <p>                            
                            Note that different countries use various different policies and procedures leading to different classifications of determining whether a person died from COVID-19 or underlying conditions. This index should be treated as a quantitative measure of how countries and their citizens are affected by COVID-19 and should not be interpreted as the likelihood of death once a person is diagnosed with the virus.
